				h3 About
				p.
					TerrierTech is software engineering consultancy providing advice on building software applications with cutting edge javascript and related technologies.
					We can assist across the whole software stack from stylesheets right the way through to the database.
				h4 Single Page applications
				p.
					While immersive user experiences are an essential part of a successful product the pace of innovation in Model View Controller frameworks and other technologies is bewildering.
					TerrierTech has extensive experience in working with all of the major MVC frameworks starting with the venerable <a href="http://backbonejs.org/" title="backbone.js" target="blank">Backbone</a> and leading to the futuristic <a target="blank" href="https://facebook.github.io/react/" title="react.js">React</a>.
					If you have a greenfield project and need help picking between <a href="http://emberjs.com/" title="ember.js" target="blank">Ember</a> and <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/" title="knockout" target="blank">Knockout</a> or have a legacy <a href="https://angularjs.org/" title="angular.js" target="blank">Angular</a> application that needs tuning we are able to help.
				h4 Javascript on the server
				p.
					<a href="https://nodejs.org/" target="blank" title="node.js">Node.js</a> is a breakthrough technology that is performant scalable and accessible. It has made asyncronous programming easier than ever before whilist allowing web developers to use a language that they are already familar with - Javascript.
					Being able to write your server software in the same language as your client side code provides unique opportunies to architect applications and reduce the bugs and inconsistencies that always result from code duplication.
					It also enables teams to solve some of the issues that SPA's have with accessiblity, mobile performance and SEO by rendering your applications on the server.
				h4 Testing
				p.
					Testing javascript applications has always been arduous, but also nessary due to the dynamic languages lacking the safefty that comes with a compiler.
					Modern testing libaries provide many features that make verifying that you applications work as expected with far less pain.
					TerrierTech will build you a test suite that gives you the confidence that you need without big maintaince costs or onerous build times.
					We are big fans of <a href="http://jasmine.github.io/" target="blank" title="jasmine">Jasmine</a>, <a href="http://mochajs.org/" target="blank" title="mocha">Mocha</a> and the brilliant <a href="http://karma-runner.github.io/0.12/index.html" title="karma" target="blank">Karma</a> test runner.
